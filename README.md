# Live-Weather-Board
A raspberry pi based project to create a LED Neo-pixel display that is capable of showing a live radar view.

Using the raspberry pi platform, the goal is to create a Neo-pixel display board that will mimic a meteorological map. By scraping the relevant atmospheric data 
for a matrix of cities, a Neo-Pixel display can be controlled to output this data. The Neo-Pixel display will be arranged in a manor to resemnble the US map, where 
each Neo-Pixel represents a city/region on the map that can be lit up according to the data reading.
